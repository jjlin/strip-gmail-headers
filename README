'strip-gmail-headers.py' is a simple Python script that strips (removes) a
few header items from a saved copy of a Gmail message that is formatted for
printing.

The following items are removed:

* The Gmail logo, and the name/email address.
* The subject line.
* The from, to, and date line.

This script has been tested only with Firefox, though in principle, it should
work with other browsers as well.

To use this script (assuming Firefox):

1) From an open Gmail message, select "Print". A new window or tab pops up
   with the contents of the message, formatted for printing. A print dialog
   box may also pop up; exit out of this.

2) From the web browser menu, select "Save Page As". Pick an easy file name
   (e.g., "foo.html"). Make sure to select the "Web Page, complete" option.

3) Run 'strip-gmail-headers.py foo.html'. This rewrites 'foo.html' to a
   version that removes the items listed above.

4) Reload the saved version in the browser and print.

There seem to be other methods of doing similar things floating around out
there, mostly involving Greasemonkey scripts, but I haven't tried them; this
script works fine for my purposes.
